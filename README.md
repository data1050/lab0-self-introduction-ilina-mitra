Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :) 


Hi! My name is Ilina Mitra and I am from Washington D.C. I am a first year master's student but graduated college in 2018 so I was working for two years before grad school. My favorite food is sushi (I used to live in Japan!).
